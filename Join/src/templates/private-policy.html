    <h3>Storage time</h3>
    <p>Unless a specific storage period is mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us
        until the purpose for data processing ceases. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your
        consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we have no other legally permissible reasons for
        retaining your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods). In the latter case, deletion will
        occur once these reasons no longer apply.</p>
    <h3>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</h3>
    <p>If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data, we process your personal data based on
        Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR if special
        categories of data are processed according to Article 9(1) of the GDPR. In the case of explicit consent for the
        transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Article 49(1)(a) of the GDPR.
        If you have given your consent to the storage of cookies or access to information on your terminal device (e.g.,
        via device fingerprinting), the data processing additionally takes place based on ยง 25(1) of the German
        Telemedia Act (TTDSG). Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a
        contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Article 6(1)(b) of
        the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for
        compliance with a legal obligation based on Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR. The data processing may also be based
        on our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. The relevant legal bases applicable in
        each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke your consent at any
        time. The legality of data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to object to data collection in certain cases and to direct marketing (Article 21 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>If data processing is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing
        of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation, including profiling based
        on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy
        policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling
        legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing
        serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (objection under Article 21(1) of the GDPR).</p>
    <p>If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time
        to the processing of your personal data for such marketing purposes, including profiling to the extent that it
        is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will no longer be used for direct
        marketing purposes (objection under Article 21(2) of the GDPR), including any associated profiling.</p>
    <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, especially in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the
        alleged infringement. This right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or
        judicial remedies</p>
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to receive the personal data that we process automatically based on your consent or in
        fulfillment of a contract, in a commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have it transmitted to
        yourself or to a third party of your choice. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another
        controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>
    <h3>Information, correction and deletion</h3>
    <p>In accordance with applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain free information about your stored
        personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing. You may also have the right to
        have this data corrected or deleted. For this purpose, as well as for any further questions regarding personal
        data, you can always contact us.</p>
    <h3>Right to restrict processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
        time to exercise this right. The right to restrict processing applies in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this.
            During the verification period, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
            personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawfully conducted, you have the right to request the
            restriction of the data processing instead of deletion</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it for the exercise, defense, or establishment of
            legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
            of deletion.</li>
        <li>
            If you have lodged an objection under Article 21(1) of the GDPR, a balance must be struck between your
            interests and ours. As long as it is not yet determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
            request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the processing of your personal data has been restricted, aside from storage, these data may only be processed
        with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of the
        rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or
        a member state.</p>
